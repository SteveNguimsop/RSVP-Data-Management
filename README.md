# RSVP-Data-Management
A C++ program that manages RSVP data: reads entries from a file, processes responses, and writes confirmed attendees and statistics to an output file.
# RSVP Manager

A simple C++ program that reads RSVP entries from a file, processes them, and writes the results to an output file.
This project demonstrates basic file I/O, enums, maps, and class design in C++.

## Features
- ✅ Add or update a player's RSVP.
- ✅ Get a list of confirmed attendees.
- ✅ Count the number of Yes, No, Maybe responses.
- ✅ Count total number of participants.
- ✅ Read input from a file.
- ✅ Write output to a file.

## File Structure
```
.
├── main.cpp              // Main application logic
├── rsvp_service.h        // Header file defining classes and enums
├── rsvp_service.cpp      // Implementation of RSVP service
├── input.txt             // Input file with RSVP data
├── output.txt            // Output file generated by program
```

## Input Format
Each line in `input.txt` should be:
```
<name>,<status>
```
Where `<status>` is one of: `Yes`, `No`, `Maybe`

Example:
```
Alice,Yes
Bob,Maybe
Charlie,No
```

## Output
The program will generate `output.txt` which includes:
- List of confirmed attendees.
- Count of Yes, No, and Maybe responses.
- Total number of responses.

## How to Compile
Using g++:
```bash
g++ main.cpp rsvp_service.cpp -o rsvp
```

## How to Run
```bash
./rsvp
```

Make sure `input.txt` exists in the same directory before running.
